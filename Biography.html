<h2> Who is Mohammed صلى الله عليه وسلم ? </h2>
<p> <strong>Muhammad</strong>is the prophet and founder of Islam. Born in Meccah in 570, most of his early life was spent as a merchant. At age 40, he began to have revelations from <strong>Allah</strong> that became the basis for the Qura'n and the foundation of <em>Islam</em>. By 630 he had unified most of Arabia under a single religion.</p>  

<h2> Who contributed with him in way of Allah? </h2>
<p>He followed in the footsteps of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Abu Bakr, Omar, and Uthman, and ruled the Muslim Empire, according to the divinely revealed law of Allah, from approximately 656 to 661 CE.</p>
